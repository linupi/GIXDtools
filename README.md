Tools to analyze grazing incidence x-ray diffraction data

UnitCellIndexerGUI
------------------
A simple python3 tool that helps to find approximate unit cell parameters of organic thin films. All six parameters (a, b, c, alpha, beta, gamma) can be addjusted manually until the experimental data and the calculated reflection positions are matching.

Please note: this tool is still under development and not yet in its final version. The current version should rather be regarded as an alpha version with many important features still missing.
